Software dedicated to empirical table testing

How it works:
1. Input the number of subsystems you'd like to rank
2. List out the number of factors you are considering
3. Tables will be generated according to your inputs above
4. Modify the factors in the tables and their corresponding weightage and begin ranking each subsystem's efficiency with each factor
5. The software will automatically generate a "weighted value" calculated by the rating you gave and the weightage of each factor
6. The highest weightage is the most optimal subsystem for you!
